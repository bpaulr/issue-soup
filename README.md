# Issue-Soup

A package for creating version control issues, with custom labels/tags, from
in-line code comments.

Note: this project was highly inspired by Tsoding's [Snitch](https://github.com/tsoding/snitch)
and I have iterated upon it in my own way.

All work is my own, of which I mean I have not copied any code or architecture
from anyone else.

However, again, praise for the base idea goes to [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding/).
